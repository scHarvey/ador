# React Workshop

Hey Everyone - Wes here. I'll be your instructor for the react workshop. I need you to do a few things before you come to the workshop.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Node.js installed. If you don't have it, or are an older version, you can visit Nodejs.org and download the installer.
2. Download the starter files + notes:
	* Download the zip here: https://github.com/wesbos/React-Beer-Me/archive/master.zip
3. Have a terminal application ready. The built in terminal works just great though I find Windows users prefer to use CMDER - http://cmder.net/
4. `npm install` all dependencies before you come. cd into your `starter-files` directory and type `npm install`. If you aren't comfortable in the terminal, you may wait until the morning of the workshop to get a hand with this. 
5. Make sure your text editor is setup to handle React. You may use any editor but here are some good ones:
	* Sublime Text with [Babel-Sublime](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime) syntax highlighter installed
	* [Atom](https://atom.io/) with the default JavaSCript
	* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the default JavaScript highlighter.
