# An Intro to React Workshop

This is a 1 day, 6-8 hour workshop aimed at understanding the fundamentals of React. Throughout the day we will work to incrementally build an application touching all every major point of React:

* Creating Components and writing HTML with JSX
* Routing with React Router
* Understanding State and holding data
* Passing data between components with with Props
* Fetching data from an Ajax endpoint
* Persisting data with LocalStorage
* Working with Events in React
* Working with Forms, retrieving data from DOM inputs
* Stateless Functional Components
* React Deployment

Together we will build <http://React.beer>, an interactive Beer explorer single page application. Along the way we will learn each fundamental concept, take time to implement it in our application and understand both the _Whys_ and _hows_ of the way React works.

Students are expected to have Beginner to intermediate JavaScript skills and be comfortable moving around folder systems via the commandline. 

## What To Bring

Bring a laptop with:

* the latest version of Node.js Installed - you can download the installer over at Nodejs.org. If you aren't sure if you have node installed, open a terminal window and type `node -v`, compare that against the latest version at http://nodejs.org
* A terminal / command line application. For Windows I recommend [cmder](http://cmder.net/), though the built in one will work just fine. For OSX built in Terminal, [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) or [Hyper.app]https://hyperterm.now.sh/) will work as well. 
* A text editor. You may use any editor but here are some good ones:
	* Sublime Text with [Babel-Sublime](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime) syntax highlighter installed
	* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
