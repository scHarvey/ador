## Our First React Component

Now - we can't just be writing all of our HTML inside of the render method â€” we need to break things up into their own components. Let's write our first React component. 

In React, everything is a component. You can think of our application as many parts that we piece together to make an application as a whole. 

Let's look at the front page of our app. What are the components we are going to make?

Let's start with a `Header.js` component. In react, since components are sort of like classes that can be reused over and over, it's a standard practice to name your files and components with a capital.

So in a folder named `components`, create `components/Header.js`. 

Now there are a few things we need to create a component:

1. React itself

```js
import React from 'react';
```

Notice that even though we have imported React into `index.js`, we also import it in here. Modules are not global and you _must_ re-import the react library into every point that you need it. 

Then we create our component and store it in a variable. We extend `React.Component` to create the react class here.

## Quick Aside

We are extending React.Component here with ES6 classes. Since ES6 classes currently fall short of a few much needed properties, we will be using some features that are "soon-to-come" to JavaScript to fill in those holes. 

The major shortcoming of ES6 classes and React is that the keyword `this` is not bound to the component instance. To get around this, we will be using [class properties](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-class-properties/) which are not yet in the language but will be compiled down for us. I'll be sure to touch on this as we learn, but this is a heads up that you may see some JS syntax that you have never encountered before.

## Back to it

Every React component will have multiple methods that live inside it, but the one method that we absolutely need is the `render()` method. This is a pre-defined method that React looks for when it displays the content on our page. 

Let's type this one together to get the hang of the syntax and answer the following questions along the way:

1. Why do we use `const`?
2. What is this `render() {}` business? should it not be `render: function() {}`?
3. Why is there (parens) around everything?

```js
class Header extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Beer Me!</h1>
    )
  }
};
```

Finally, since we will need to import this component into other components, we need to **export it** with `export default Header`.

Our final code looks like this:

```js
import React from 'react';

class Header extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Beer Me!</h1>
    )
  }
};

export default Header;

```


### Displaying `<Header/>`

We have now made a Header component. Swap out the `<p>Hello World</p>` with our new Header component in `index.js`. We can use the "tag" `<Header/>` to reference our component:

```js
render(<Header />, document.querySelector('#root'));
```

But you'll see that we get this error:

That is because we haven't yet **imported** our component into index.js! 

```js
import Header from './components/Header';
```

Since the component is not part of our `node_modules` directory, we do a relative reference with `./`. Refresh your page and you should now see the title:
